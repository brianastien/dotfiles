= Adam Hutchison's Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. They are heavily
inspired by Ryan Bates' Dot Files (http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling.

== Features

Tab completion is available for rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and 
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in 
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in
the prompt while in a git repository.
